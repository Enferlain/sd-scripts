- versioning for contracts is probably a good idea for the long run. Contracts and trainer might need to evolve over time as more models get added, but the ideal scenario is them not having to, especially the trainer, but this is only possible to accomplish via the repo growing with new capabilites and testing said contract and trainer.

### excerpts

I'd probably make it something like

folder called tools or capabilitiesor features or shared or grab box/
clip.py (a bit dubious since clip is understood as a component but it's not defined and used from a venv, might move to repo hosted definitions, we'll need to weigh the pros and cons)
diffusion/
pixel_diffusion.py
latent_diffusion.py

And such. Thoughts?

Technically, in the ultimate understanding of this system you would also grab box model components so strategies can be built aribtrarily from them, but that's like end game stuff (1 autoencoder vs the other, different text encoders, llms as vision, whatever u desire)

---

regardless of what we do the grab box thing will probaly be the future, at least that's how I feel like right now. When systems become too difficult to reason with, the easuiest method is to just organize them better. the entire strategy system is one attempted organization of the original sd-scripts repo, which was a shithole from an architecture standpoint.

---

what about using decorators instead of names like somethingsomethingfeature or somethingsomethingcomponent or whatever

@feature 
class LatentDiffusion

feels like ppl often forget they exist while they sound useful, but maybe not here, I'm not sure

---

my current stance as we discussed before is that I like the contract idea centralizing strategy (your training "plan") and handing it to the active trainer layer so it doesn't need to track or know about individual parts, but that's not how it happens today, and the contracts despite being made "strict" are not really respected in the way we imagined it when we came up with the system. and the part about being able to grab features and eventually components for your strategy is pretty attractive as a goal. Then there's also decisions (vae vs autoencoder lanugage, specific component, names, handling, separation, etc basically same with "clip") about the models folder

I didn't read through the inventory fully yet, this is just my thoughts. we should work with our design docs (direction and now inventory) in general unless we decide on other details and actions. what should we do next?

---

1 let's try to make the contracts like this:

a basic idea built on what we have today, intuition about what we might have in the future extrapolated from the direction we want to move to, what "training a neural network" means, and what is needed to be able to train something in our repo today (this can be very narrow technically so let's start from where we are at)

---

the "run" doesn't select things, these are defined in the strategy build the same as today, just under the new contract. it might constrain or validate it (where this happens is not decided from what I've read so far). the contract defines what must be fulfilled and what is available to use whether it's a slot that needs to be filled or something that you're picking for yourself. we're not going for a super smart mind reader system that automatically picks things based on implication, at least not for now. strategies should be built with intent. we can validate that the choices are correct, but that's different from a feature dragging another with it, that should still be left to whoever is putting the strategy together. (and this is us, we make the default training strategies for models aka what you see currently)

This process is manual, it's not done by a hydra replacement or a config system, at least not initially anyways. It's the same as how model code is still written by hand. strategy is essentially "the model code" in this repo. there might be a config equivalent that can do the task of putting together a strategy in the future to make things more streamlined, but that's not current goal

---

yes. there is essentially no noob mode on strategy besides "trainer needs something to train chief)" and even that can be overridden if someone wants it, or allowed for mutated/adopted/custom strategies besides the base model training strategies as that would go against the spirit of experimentation and research

if you know this repo it takes a similar approach at a base level, although it's not for training [ljleb/sd-mecha](https://github.com/ljleb/sd-mecha)

---

basically we didn't change the overall goal, because we are still the ones that put the strategies together, we just establish the mechanics around the contract (which covers the constraints as well) and the intended way to interact with the strategy system

if any updates should be made to [strategy_system_direction.md](docs_design/models-strategy-trainer/strategy_system_direction.md) now is a good time before context compacts

---

well this should be dictated by the trainer no? which also dictates the contract. idk if this means strategy passes a bundled item that the trainer then needs to unpack, or how this is handled in python/other repos normally

---

we might not necessarily want to be constrained by an existing system unless it allows for modification based on our own designs, that would be the deciding factor about whether or not we adopt something. and we also keep the code in our repo, which means we become the maintainers
